# landing-page

This is the Landing Page project for the Odin Project Foundations course.

I really enjoyed trying to put some ideas together into a full page. Lots to learn, and super messy, but feel like I'm making progress here.

The brand is Jambooks. It's a company I actually own that's being developed by a professional currently. I'm learning some basics so I can do timely tweaks to the functions of another web-based SAAS company I own - RateNow.

Anyway, going good. On to javascript. Heaven help us all.
